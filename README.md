# Debian ELTS Advisories

This repository contains security advisories for Debian LTS in JSON format. 

TODO:

- [ ] The data is automatically updated.
- [ ] This will be synced to the GSD repository
- [ ] Switch to the OSV format.

## Source:

- Updates are fetched from the LTS Announcements: https://www.freexian.com/lts/extended/updates/
- as listed via the [Sitemap](https://www.freexian.com/sitemap.xml)
- The data is also published at https://deb.freexian.com/extended-lts/tracker/data/json, but it doesn't include the announcement URLs, and harder to use.
